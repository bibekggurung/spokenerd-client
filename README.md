The words that they add has fields correspoding to the form of the word, the definition, it's part of speech, and the origin language. When the user bring up their created words, they appear as flashcards that show the form of the word on one side and flip over to the side with the definition, it's part of speech, and the origin language.

Each entry can also be edited or deleted.

Process: The application began as a simple dictionary where the user could create entries and they would be pulled up at the press of a button with all of their keys visible. The second version of the SPA became a flash card app throuhg the use of bootstrap to implement transitions. Inititally, all resources could be viewed by all users although editing was locked. THis was also changed in the second version of the app, when views were locked.
